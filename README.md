### Extension Structure
As a user, you set the url to a youtube video you want to play.
When you press your selected shortcut for the extension several things
can happen depending on you browser's current state.

1. If none of your tabs are audible, create a new tab with your selected url. 
2. If your current tab is audible and it is not the url and the url is in another tab, pause current tab and play url. 
3. If url is playing, pause url and play saved tab.

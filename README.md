### Extension Structure
As a user, pin the extension to the browser. Once pinned, when clicked a popup should 
come up. In the popup paste the url or the youtube video you want to toggle. Set a shortcut
to activate the extensions toggle functionality. When you press your selected shortcut for the extension,
one of several things can happen depending on you browser's current state.

1. If none of your tabs are audible, the extension creates a new tab with your selected url. 
2. If your current tab is audible and it is not your selected url and the url is in another tab, pause current tab and play url. 
3. If url is playing, pause url and play saved tab.
